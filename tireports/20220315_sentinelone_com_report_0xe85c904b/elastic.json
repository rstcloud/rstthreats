This previously undiscovered set of activity centers around a Python-compiled binary that masquerades as Ukrainian language translation software, leading to the infection of GrimPlant, and GraphSteel.\nSentinelOne assesses UAC-0056s GrimPlant and GraphSteel activity began in early February 2022, while preparation for its use began at least as early as December 2021."
