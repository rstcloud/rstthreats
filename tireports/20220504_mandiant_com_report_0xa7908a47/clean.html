<p>Since July 2021, Mandiant identified exploitation of public-facing web applications by UNC2903 to harvest and abuse credentials using Amazon’s Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). Mandiant tracked access attempts by UNC2903 to access S3 buckets and additional cloud resources using the stolen credentials. This blog post covers how UNC2903 performed exploitation and IMDS abuse, as well as related best practices on cloud hardening techniques.</p>
<p>Although UNC2903 targeted Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments, many other cloud platforms offer similar metadata services that could be at risk of similar attacks. Similar threat actor motives and operations are gaining prominence as enterprises continue their migration to cloud hosting services. This article also describes potential risks and considerations for security and information technology teams using hosted services.</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mandiant’s Incident Response, Intelligence, and Transformational Services teams collected information described in this blog post to help better detect, prevent, and respond to similar opportunistic intrusions. The following timeline describes UNC2903 activity performed during their earliest observed campaigns. </p>
<ul><li>February 2021, <a href="https://advantage.mandiant.com/cve/vulnerability--5a1fbe9b-f51e-5cdb-8e5f-25681276b02f">CVE-2021-21311</a> was <a href="https://github.com/vrana/adminer/security/advisories/GHSA-x5r2-hj5c-8jx6">published</a> describing vulnerable database administration software called Adminer</li>
<li>February 2021, proof-of-concept code (PoC) was published to show how to leverage the exploit and obtain credentials in AWS applications hosting vulnerable versions</li>
<li>June 2021, UNC2903 exploited a server-side request forgery vulnerability, gaining access to victim Amazon Web Services secret keys and subsequently steal data </li>
</ul><p>Although this blog post discusses a now patched version of Adminer software, any web-application vulnerable to request forgery or remote code execution may also open avenues for similar metadata service attacks. </p>
<h2>Usage in the Wild and Evidence of Exploitation </h2>
<h3>The Threat Landscape for Cloud Metadata</h3>
<p>Mandiant’s analysts identified recent upticks in the abuse and exploitation of services hosted in AWS and similar cloud platforms. The threats identified in campaigns carried out by UNC2903 were multi-phased attacks, which involved infrastructure scanning, reconnaissance and further abuse of the underlying abstraction layers offered by cloud-hosted platforms. Once exploitation and abuse of the underlying systems occurred, stolen credentials are leveraged for data exfiltration in other AWS services in the compromised tenant. </p>
<p>Namely, for events leading up to UNC2903 stealing data, Mandiant’s <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/services/incident-response">Incident Response</a> team identified:</p>
<ol><li>Network scanning attempts on externally facing AWS web infrastructure hosting Adminer software</li>
<li>Additional web navigation and reconnaissance performed, once infrastructure is identified</li>
<li>Attempts of multiple web application exploits which may exist on the hosted web server </li>
<li>Further attempts indicative of manual exploitation and testing using the identified exploit</li>
</ol><p>Given that the infrastructure is hosted within Amazon Web Services cloud, IMDS is an attractive target for threat actors like UNC2903. In UNC2903’s case, the threat actor was observed targeting exploitable web applications which were also running IMDSv1. Amazon’s IMDSv1 permits web requests to a specialized URL against the link local IP address (169.254.169.254) which was designed to enhance internal service communication and troubleshooting within the overall hosting platform. The retrievable metadata includes information to understand configuration, topology, and even obtain user role and credentialing. </p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/">released IMDSv2</a> to add additional layers of protection and alerting through AWS security features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/">GuardDuty</a>. The way IMDSv2 remediates this type of attack is by a user obtaining a token via a PUT from http://169.254.169[.]254/latest/api/token, then that token is used and repeated for all requests to the IMDS via a special header (<code>x-aws-ec2-metadata-token</code>). </p>
<p>Although Amazon recommends implementing the IMDSv2 with GuardDuty enhancements, EC2 instances created by Amazon customers that instead use IMDSv1 may be at risk when combined with also running unpatched vulnerable third party software. As the adoption of cloud technology expands, so does the threat surface and targeting for vulnerable web infrastructure with underlying dated or deprecated metadata services with limited security capabilities. The level of risk related to web application vulnerabilities should be evaluated and paired with the understanding that underlying metadata services in cloud environments could increase the possibility of advanced or continued threats.</p>
<h3>Clever Techniques, Some SSRF, and Easy Access</h3>
<p>Mandiant has observed in campaigns that UNC2903 utilized a dedicated operational relay box to perform web scanning and carry out exploitation and related IMDSv1 abuse. The threat actor carries out a series of web scans and activity consistent with manual reconnaissance of the identified application prior to the attack. The attack observed by UNC2903 utilized a Server-Side Request Forgery (“SSRF”) vulnerability to return the temporary access keys used for AWS S3 bucket storage access. </p>
<p>Figure 1 provides the critical attack path identified during UNC2903 using CVE-2021-21311.</p>

<h3>Artifacts and Notable Observations</h3>
<p>Mandiant Incident Response identified and collected artifacts of the related exploitation and IMDS abuse carried out by UNC2903. The activity recorded from initial scanning and exploitation, as well as the AWS metadata service and credential abuse may be subject to the configuration of the hosted infrastructure and cloud logs available in the tenant. Without a security operator’s keen eye on event logs, even with increased levels of logging enabled, similar attacks carried out by UNC2903—or other threat actors—may go undetected.</p>
<p>Since the attack leverages an exploit of the Adminer PHP application page, the malicious navigation and interaction may be easily overlooked by investigators. The activity identified is characteristically unique compared to some exploits which return a standard successful web response to the screen or within recorded event logs. </p>
<p>The few sources which evidenced the exploitation and abuse included:</p>
<ul><li>Web access and error logs</li>
<li>GuardDuty events</li>
<li>VPC Flow Logs</li>
<li>S3 Data and Access Events</li>
</ul><p>Figure 7 provides an example of the initial access and web application scanning activity identified for the Adminer web page. Note that the web response shows a 302 redirect or other 403 error as the web response in the available log although the exploit was successful.</p>
<figure><img alt="Web access logs generated after a simulated attacker types in their server information and performs CVE-2021-21311" height="632" src="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/cloud-metadata-unc2903-fig7.png" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1894"/><figcaption>Figure 7: Web access logs generated after a simulated attacker types in their server information and performs CVE-2021-21311</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 8 provides an example of a VPC flow which represents the web server when the SSRF completes. Note that the victim server which made the outbound request is suspicious to an external IP address. However, the port could be configured to any desired, or more discrete, port chosen for an attack. </p>
<figure><img alt="AWS VPC flow logs noting that the simulated victim server made a web request outbound over a malicious port 1337" height="432" src="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/cloud-metadata-unc2903-fig8.png" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1886"/><figcaption>Figure 8: AWS VPC flow logs noting that the simulated victim server made a web request outbound over a malicious port 1337</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 9 provides an example of a GuardDuty event after credentials are stolen and leveraged. Note that GuardDuty in our testing alerted after data theft was complete from the S3 bucket.</p>
<figure><img alt="AWS GuardDuty event showing data theft from S3 using the stolen metadata credential" height="1180" src="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/cloud-metadata-unc2903-fig9.png" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1894"/><figcaption>Figure 9: AWS GuardDuty event showing data theft from S3 using the stolen metadata credential</figcaption></figure><h3>Mission Completion and Future Implications</h3>
<p>Final phases of attacks carried out by UNC2903, and similar threat actors, have involved data exfiltration or interaction with the AWS tenant. The information stolen through application exploitation and metadata service abuse could allow threat actors to manipulate or steal data from an organization’s cloud environments. Abuse of similar cloud-oriented metadata services show how threat actors can further exploit environments beyond the original application targets. When architecting cloud services and solutions, configurations for prevention and response should be evaluated and considered by the technology teams. Later, we cover potential strategies to mitigate, limit, and aid in unauthorized metadata service usage detection. </p>
<h2>Mandiant Intelligence Findings</h2>
<h3>Attribution</h3>
<p>UNC2903 is a group whose motivations are unknown and tracked by Mandiant since July 2021. UNC2903 is opportunistic, hunting for vulnerable systems on the internet, and has been observed stealing data from at least one victim, however, Mandiant did not observe any monetization of the stolen data such as extortion or sale. Analysis of web logs showed that the actors were specifically scanning for adminer.php and testing for CVE-2019-0211, an Apache Root Privilege Escalation to install the WSO webshell, directly from GitHub.</p>
<p>Eighteen minutes after the CVE-2021-21311 vulnerable adminer.php was discovered by the threat actor through automated scanning, Mandiant observed indexing of the adminer.php by Telegram bot, indicating that the link to the adminer.php was shared in a Telegram chat group. A few minutes later, an automated session from a free VPN service also scanned the adminer.php. The same automated process was executed from different a different IP a few hours later, followed by interactive activity and successful access of the IMDS service 3 hours and 15 minutes after the initial access.</p>
<h3>Scanning Activity</h3>
<p>Mandiant observed indications that the UNC2903 infrastructure was used to scan over 2,100 IP addresses in late June 2021. Scanning focused on web services such as port 80 or 443 and did not focus on any specific service provider suggesting the actor may have been operating from a list of targets with open HTTP ports from prior research and not targeting any specific service provider.</p>
<h3>User Agent Strings</h3>
<p>User agent strings used by UNC2903 observed by Mandiant:</p>
<ul><li>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.101 Safari/537.36 Edg/91.0.864.48</li>

<li>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0</li>
</ul><h2>Transform Security and Mitigate Similar Threats</h2>
<p>Mandiant recommends organizations detect, remediate, and prevent EC2 Instances from having IMDSv1 enabled. Before remediating and converting EC2 Instances to use IMDSv2, the organization should test all instances/application to ensure the operations will not be impacted by such remediation measures.</p>
<p>Using our vulnerable Adminer web application, once the EC2 Instance running the application has IMDSv2 enabled, the secrets/credentials are no longer able to be obtained by the threat actor (see Figure 10).</p>
<figure><img alt="Error message received when attempted to obtain credentials from an EC2 Instance with IMDSv2 enforced" height="766" src="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/cloud-metadata-unc2903-fig10.png" style="max-width:800px;height:auto;width:auto;" width="1918"/><figcaption>Figure 10: Error message received when attempted to obtain credentials from an EC2 Instance with IMDSv2 enforced</figcaption></figure><p>Next we will provide multiple ways an organization can detect, remediate, and prevent IMDSv1 from their environment. </p>

</ul><h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>As organizations move further into cloud environments, additional complexities of default settings can offer opportunities for an attacker to leverage access from one system, to pivot to many others similar. Data stored in cloud systems can be stolen, tampered, or deleted just like any other environment. Mandiant’s expertise in responding to intrusions extends to cloud environments which continue to be targeted both by espionage and financially motivated groups.</p>
