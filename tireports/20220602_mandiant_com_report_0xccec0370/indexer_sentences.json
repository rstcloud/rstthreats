This actors underground forum activity is consistent with TTPs used in UNC2165 operations. We also identified a GitHub profile matching the actors username, and while the accounts activity is limited, it is consistent with UNC2165 operations. Most notably, the actor opened an issue for a project in which they included command line arguments showing that they were attempting to build a .csproj shellcode runner. UNC2165 used .csproj files extensively during this time period to deploy BEACON payloads and has leveraged .csproj files to deploy BEACON that are consistent with the project for which the issue was opened. In April 2022, the actor appeared to purchase VPN access to a wholesale distribution company with an annual revenue of $3 billion USD and has expressed interest in purchasing additional network accesses. Although less common, we have seen UNC2165 use suspected stolen credentials in intrusions. Between December 2019 and August 2020, the actor posted at least twice on exploit[.]in seeking to purchase versions of Cobalt Strike. Beginning in July 2019, they have made several posts on exploit[.]in seeking services and tools for obfuscating malware to avoid detection."}

This has included sanctions on both actors directly involved in ransomware operations as well as cryptocurrency exchanges that have received illicit funds. These sanctions have had a direct impact on threat actor operations, particularly as at least some companies involved in ransomware remediation activities, such as negotiation, refuse to facilitate payments to known sanctioned entities. This can ultimately reduce threat actors' ability to be paid by victims, which is the primary driver of ransomware operations."}

Both the prominence of LOCKBIT in recent years and its successful use by several different threat clusters likely made the ransomware an attractive choice. Using this RaaS would allow UNC2165 to blend in with other affiliates, requiring visibility into earlier stages of the attack lifecycle to properly attribute the activity, compared to prior operations that may have been attributable based on the use of an exclusive ransomware. Additionally, the frequent code updates and rebranding of HADES required development resources and it is plausible that UNC2165 saw the use of LOCKBIT as a more cost-effective choice. The use of a RaaS would eliminate the ransomware development time and effort allowing resources to be used elsewhere, such as broadening ransomware deployment operations. Its adoption could also temporarily afford the actors more time to develop a completely new ransomware from scratch, limiting the ability of security researchers to easily tie it to previous Evil Corp operations."}

For example, the threat actors could choose to abandon their use of FAKEUPDATES, an operation with well-documented links to Evil Corp actors in favor of a newly developed delivery vector or may look to acquire access from underground communities. Some evidence of this developing trend already exists given UNC2165 has leveraged stolen credentials in a subset of intrusions, which is consistent with a suspected members underground forum activity. We expect these actors as well as others who are sanctioned in the future to take steps such as these to obscure their identities in order to ensure that it is not a limiting factor to receiving payments from victims."}
