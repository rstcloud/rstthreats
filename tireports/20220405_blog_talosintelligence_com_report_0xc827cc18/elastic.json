This folder is used as the working directory for the malware and stores all the components used throughout the rest of the infection process.\nThe script then creates several additional scripts, writing content into each of them using a format similar to the following example.\nScript creation code example.\nThe following files are created in this manner:\nOffice.bat\nOffice.vbs\nOffice.ps1\nMicrosofd.bat\nMicrosofd.vbs\nMicrosofd.ps1\nAll of these scripts are stored in the previously created directory.\nMalicious script components.\nFinally, the Stage 2 PowerShell executes \"Office.vbs\" to begin the next step of the infection process.\nVBS execution."

This next VBS initiates a short sleep before continuing. It is only responsible for executing \"Microsofd.bat\" to continue the infection process.\nWScript execution.\nThis next batch file only contains a single line, which invokes PowerShell and executes 'Microsofd.ps1'\nPowerShell execution.\nThis PowerShell script is the final script executed in this chain. It was written by the Stage 2 PowerShell, along with the other scripts that we've described. This script contains two large GZIP blobs and another function responsible for decompressing them.\nStage 3 decompression function.\nOne of the blobs is an injector and the other is the final payload that is injected and executed. This is accomplished by invoking aspnet_compiler.exe, injecting the final payload, and executing it.\nStage 3 injection process.\nThe diagram below shows the execution flow.\nInfection flow diagram.\nThe final payload varied across samples analyzed, the majority of which were AsyncRAT and LimeRAT. Based on the RAT configuration embedded in the samples, we believe with high confidence that the same threat actor(s) are likely leveraging both RATs in these campaigns."

            "text": "During our analysis of the samples, infrastructure and final payloads associated with these campaigns, we identified several characteristics that indicated a new version of the 3LOSH builder/crypter used to obfuscate the RAT payloads and facilitate the infection process. 3LOSH crypter is a malware crypter we previously analyzed\nhere\n.\nIn analyzing the code execution of the Stage 2 PowerShell, we noticed some similarities with later stages of the infection process described in our previous analysis of the 3LOSH builder. The code present in our initial sample set featured a significant amount of similarities and overlap with samples we identified associated with a new version of 3LOSH. This new version of the crypter features the following notable changes from previous versions.\nBinary payloads are now embedded using GZIP compression rather than simply Base64 encoded and scripts feature a decompression function that is the same across both sample clusters.\nThe infection chain is more complicated, featuring the use of multiple script-based components (BAT, VBS, PS1) that facilitate the infection process.\nWhile there are also differences between the two clusters, this may be due to the threat actor only utilizing the portion of the builder output required for their purposes, or this may be due to options selected during the build process.\nAdditionally, while analyzing our original sample cluster and new samples created using the 3LOSH crypter, we identified several final payloads in both clusters that use the same infrastructure for post-compromise C2 communications.\nMatching RAT configs in both sample clusters.\nWhile analyzing one of the AsyncRAT payloads in our original sample cluster, we also observed that the Group_ID in the embedded RAT configuration was set to \"3LOSH.\"\n3LOSH group identifier\n3LOSH continues to be under active development and in use by threat actors distributing a variety of commodity RATs. We expect that this activity will continue and organizations should ensure they maintain the ability to detect malicious activity associated with 3LOSH, independent of the final payload itself."

The 3LOSH crypter continues to be actively maintained and improved by its author and will likely continue to be used by various threat actors attempting to evade detection in corporate environments. Organizations should be aware that even commodity malware can take advantage of the complexity and evasiveness offered by crypters to increase their operational effectiveness as adversaries attempt to leverage them to achieve their mission objectives. A layered defense-in-depth security architecture should be implemented to ensure that organizations maintain the ability to successfully defend against these threats."
