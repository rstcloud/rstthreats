            "text": "Since humans are still the weakest link in cybersecurity, threat actor(s) continue to prey on fallible human nature to launch cyberattacks. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to impact the global economy and draw worldwide attention, these tensions create opportunities for threat actor(s) to designing campaigns to exploit human vulnerabilities and anxieties stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nHeaderTip is a malware used by threat actor(s) that are leveraging the current Russia-Ukraine conflict to spread persistent malware. eSentire Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that HeaderTip serves as a backdoor and a loader for threat actor(s) to further deploy rootkits, trojans, or other types of malware.\neSentires Threat Intelligence team has performed a technical malware analysis on HeaderTip. This technical analysis provides a breakdown of how HeaderTip achieves the persistence on the infected machine and how it obfuscates the code to evade detections.\nKey Takeaways:\neSentire Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the initial access vector for HeaderTip was a phishing attack.\nThe threat actor(s) is using obfuscation techniques in the malware sample to hinder the analysis and avoid detection.\nThe malware achieves the persistence via Registry Run Keys that link to the dropped files in %TEMP% folder.\nHeaderTip utilizes ChangeIP for Dynamic DNS (DDNS), which allows the attacker(s) to evade detections.\neSentires Threat Response Unit (TRU) created two new detections to identify the HeaderTip malware."

The malware campaign is dubbed as HeaderTip and is being tracked as UAC-0026.\nCERT-UA reported that they observed similar activity in September 2020. In addition, researchers at SentinelOne have tied\nthe malware campaign to the suspected Chinese group of threat actors known as Scarab. The Scarab malware was first observed in 2012 targeting organizations in Russia, Ukraine, United States, Chile, and Syria."

The 32-bit executable is written in C++ programming language with a file size of 653 KB.\nAn overview of the malicious files, domains and IPs related to HeaderTip (Exhibit 1).\nExhibit 1: Overview of HeaderTip malicious files from VirusTotal graph\nThe executable file contains the .RCData section with an embedded PDF file which is likely used as a bait. The PDF document contains information from the National Police of Ukraine with instructions on how to retain video evidence on criminal activities conducted by the Russian military in Ukraine so they can be used in investigations by the Criminal Investigative Division of Ukraine (Exhibits 2-3).\nThe metadata indicates that the PDF document was created on March 16, 2022, which is the exact date when the document was issued and signed.

Additionally, the batch file sets up a persistence mechanism via Registry Run Keys. The officecleaner.dat file is removed from %TEMP% folder after successfully renaming itself (Exhibit 4).\nThe de-obfuscated command is used to add the Registry Run Key with the key name OAService to run the malicious httpshelper.dll\nfile:\nreg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v \"httpshelper\" /d \"c:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe httpshelper.dll,OAService\" /f start c:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe httpshelper.dll,OAService\nExhibit 4: The contents of the .BAT file\nThe third resource contains a .DLL file with a missing executable (MZ) header (Exhibit 5).\nExhibit 5: Resource containing the .DLL file\nUpon analyzing the executable file in a disassembler, we found another value being added to the Registry Run Keys (Exhibit 6):\n/c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run /v httpsrvlog /t REG_SZ /d\nThe added httpsrvlog key is responsible for running the officecleaner.bat file under the %TEMP% directory.\nExhibit 6: Registry Run Key added for httpsrvlog value\nWe have observed the following files being dropped onto the %TEMP% folder after the running the malicious executable:\nofficecleaner.bat: the batch file responsible for persistence of the .DLL file.\nofficecleaner.dat: the malicious .DLL file (before the PC reboot or execution of a batch file).\nhttpshelper.dll: the malicious .DLL file (after the PC reboot or execution of a batch file)\n#2163_02_33-2022.pdf: the decoy PDF file."

            "text": "The 32-bit .DLL file is written in C++ programming language. The size of the file is relatively small 9.50 KB. Upon analyzing the file in a disassembler, we have noticed that the malware is hiding the API imports by applying the stackstrings and dynamically resolving APIs at runtime (Exhibit 7).\nExhibit 7: Using stackstrings for obfuscation\nThe malware hashes the libraries and API functions by applying ROR-13 calculation to evade detections. LoadLibraryA is used to load the Wininet library, which contains the functions that enables the application to interact with HTTP protocol in our malware sample. GetProcAddress API is used to resolve the functions address. (Exhibit 8-9).\nExhibit 8: Resolved APIs and kernel32 DLL\nExhibit 9: Using GetProcAddress to resolve the functions\nThe malicious DLL initiates the connection to the C2 domain over port 8080, the function resides in export named OAService\n(Exhibit 10). The threat actor(s) is utilizing Dynamic DNS (DDNS) from ChangeIP with the hardcoded domain in the DLL sample, which means that the infected machines can connect to C2 servers using a domain name instead of IP address. This gives the threat actor(s) a huge benefit as they can change or not have to rely on IP addresses to avoid detection.\nExhibit 10: C2 connection over port 8080\nThe main C2 communication function is shown in Exhibit 11. The malware creates a POST request handle, checks if the request is successfully received from the C2 server with HTTP response code 200, and reads 128 bytes of data received from C2 server by calling InternetReadFile API (Exhibit 12). It also uses the User-Agent string, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko,\nfor C2 communications.\nExhibit 11: Main C2 function\nWe have also noticed a function containing a Loader string. We believe the function is responsible for loading the DLL into the memory by using VirtualAlloc API to allocate new memory regions inside the address space of a process (Exhibit 12). First, it compares if the file contains MZ header, then it loops through the first 4096 bytes of the DLL file (Exhibit 13).\nExhibit 13: The function loops through the first 4096 bytes of the DLL file"

Conduct regular vulnerability scans to ensure your team is staying on top of identifying, and patching, all known vulnerabilities.\nEnsure your team is enforcing strong password policies for all employees as part of strengthening your organizations overall cyber hygiene.\nImplement the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) that requires giving each user only the permissions needed to complete their task and nothing more\nWhile the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by threat actor(s) grow in sophistication, they lead to a limited set of options at which critical business decisions must be made. Intercepting the various attack paths utilized by the modern threat actor requires actively monitoring the threat landscape, developing, and deploying endpoint detection, and the ability to investigate logs & network data during active intrusions.\neSentires Threat Response Unit (TRU) is a world-class team of threat researchers who develop new detections enriched by original threat intelligence and leverage new machine learning models that correlate multi-signal data and automate rapid response to advanced threats.\nIf you are not currently engaged with an MDR provider, eSentire MDR can help you reclaim the advantage and put your business ahead of disruption.\nLearn what it means to have an elite team of Threat Hunters and Researchers that works for you.
