The disruption was quickly followed by a wiper deployed to operator workstations, as well as disruption to control center Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) systems and deploying a malicious firmware update to serial-to-ethernet devices to effectively brick the systems.

As Russias incompetence and Ukraines bravery stymied these plans, a noticeable shift to indiscriminate attacks on population centers and infrastructure was observed.
